Abou t me:  
PhD student at the University of Padua, enrolled in the Doctoral School and funded by the Italian National Cybersecurity Agency (Agenzia per la Cybersicurezza Nazionale - ACN). My research focuses on satellite communication security, with emphasis on physical layer security (PLS) and the integration of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) in non-terrestrial networks.
Through my studies in cybersecurity, I have gained experience in both theoretical and practical aspects of designing and evaluating secure computer systems. My practical skills come from various projects assigned during university courses and CTF (Capture The Flag) challenges where I strengthened my abilities in penetration testing.
I have a strong passion for science and enjoy tackling new challenges, as they provide opportunities for continuous learning and growth.
